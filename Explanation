1. The starting part is just simple user input. The user should select the face image and the image they want to swap that face to. 
  -I save both images to variables "image" and "image1" each to use in prompts later.
  -The variable "image" (the background) has another variable called "image2" that has the same image saved. This is because the variable "image" will be overwritten.

2. First step is changing the background to black. There was this issue where stuff like long hair was unable to be detected as the AI would think it is part of the background.
So I just decided to remove the whole background and add it later (through the image2 variable we kept saved).
  -There are a lot of conditions whilst creating the mannequin, but the most important is that i had the AI label leg sections as "leg" or "LEG" 
  -I can tell the AI in another prompt that any white section with that label is meant to be turned into a leg (Though, its not the most perfect process yet)

3. Next step, I just have the AI create a full body shot of the face. The theory is that seeing the arms and legs of the face will help the swap be more consistent.
I thought it would be necessary because previous body swap methods sometimes had leftover mannequin body parts simply due to the AI's visual recognition limits, so the 
fact the AI does not need to generate new body parts should help it in the swapping process. This is another benefit of changing the background to black as well 
because the white mannequin contrasts well with the background and helps the AI's visual recognition.

4. This is the actual swapping part. I previously used to tell the AI to "reconstruct" or visualize the face, but recently I've just been telling it to body swap literally.
It seems to work fine so far, but it still doesn't work when the swap is between person to person. This part is sometimes iffy, where the only issues are either only the face swapped
or the whole mannequin remained. I fixed the code, but I didn't test it extensively to see if it is fine yet. Here, is where the text "leg" is removed,
which should help the leg swapping (in theory)

5. Finally, I bring back the saved target background image in "image2" and ask the AI to change the black background to the other one. Even though this wording is vague, 
simply telling it black background makes it easy for the AI to recognize what image needs to do.
  -Even though another person is present in the background image, I've found that it is fine to leave the person and the background will still be changed. 

*There was one issue where Rapunzel's long hair would stay when the swap happened, but I think it should be 
good right now because I directly addressed that in the prompt.

6. Now, the swap should have occurred. This swap doesn't use the ChatGPT description I used to use, so the facial expression may be off. If you have any other questions, please 
feel free to ask because I have spent a lot of time dealing with annoying glitches on Nanobanana and might be able to help. :)
